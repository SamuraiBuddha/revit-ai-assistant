# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, data breach potential, Revit file corruption
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, API key exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, resource exhaustion
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### Python Security

3. **Monitoring:** Unusual file access or processing patterns

### Response
1. **Assess:** Determine severity and data/model impact
2. **Contain:** Isolate affected files and AI components
3. **Investigate:** Forensic analysis and model integrity check
4. **Remediate:** Apply fixes and restore model integrity
5. **Recover:** Restore normal operations and file access
6. **Learn:** Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Audits

### Regular Security Reviews
